# Introduction

For the solution of the Class Scheduling, we have decided to use 
non-preemptive **Shortest Job First** (**SJF**) algorithm
AND
non-preemptive **Priority Scheduling** algorithm
to schedule the classes.

# Consideration

We consider that the class:
1.  Cannot be interfered or stopped halfway

_Thus, the reason for why non-preemptive methods of the algorithms are chosen_

# Analysis

## First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Give an analysis of your algo and compare it with the other two

## Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)

Give an analysis of your algo and compare it with the other two

## Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling

Give an analysis of your algo and compare it with the other two
